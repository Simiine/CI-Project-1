                    <h2>DIY Skincare</h2>
                    <p>In recent years more and more people have been turning their attention to homemade skincare and we have seen a rise in DIY recipes online. A lot of recipes floating around online are not accurate, safe or stable. Performing a lot of these recipes without the proper information can be dangerous and could lead to skin damage.</p>
