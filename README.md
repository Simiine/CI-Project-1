# Skinwareness

Skinwareness is a website that provides useful information on skincare making. The aim of the site is to educate people on proper skincare making techniques, ingredients and best practices in order to create safe, professional and high quality products. 

The last number of years has seen a rise in DIY skincare with more people wanting more control over the products they use and transparency over ingredients used in their products. This has allowed people to not only create products that are free from harsh chemicals and ingredients but also environmentally friendly and sustanable. This unfortunately has also lead to mass amounts of misinformation online and harmful recipes floating around the internet. 

This site allows people to avoid the common pitfuls that arise when skincare making and provide simplified and factual information.
